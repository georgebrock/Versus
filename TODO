Versus TODO

- DB indices for venue foursquare ID and visit venue/user combination
- Filter venues by category
- Handling expired access tokens (or other Foursquare errors)
- Don't show the user the same permutation twice (there are TODO comments)
- Build recommendations asyncronously, e.g. with Celery
- Update venues asyncronously, e.g. with Celery
- Better test coverage
- Smarter ranking algorithm (Elo?)
- Better recommendations engine (e.g. Find venues similar to a user's top venues,
  rather than finding similar users. Venue similarity could be then be cached
  allowing for very fast recommendations. See chapter 2 of Programming Collective
  Intelligence)
